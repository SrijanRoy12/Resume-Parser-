An AI-powered tool that extracts key details like name, skills, education, and experience from resumes using NLP, and converts them into structured formats like JSON or CSV for quick analysis and automated recruitment workflows
A Resume Parser is an AI-based tool that automatically extracts important information from resumes or CVs and converts it into structured data. It helps recruiters, HR systems, or job portals quickly read, analyze, and organize large numbers of resumes.

This parser uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify and extract key sections like:

👤 Name & Contact Info

🎓 Education

💼 Work Experience

🛠️ Skills

🏆 Certifications & Achievements

🌐 Links (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

The extracted data is then stored in a readable format like JSON, CSV, or a database, making it easy to filter, search, or match candidates to job profiles.
